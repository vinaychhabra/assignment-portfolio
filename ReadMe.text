Personal Portfolio Building Assignments

Inside this repository, we have 3 folders:

Foundation: Contains index.html, style.css, and foundation.js, which are responsible for the basic structure of the portfolio.

Dynamic_Projects: Includes index.html, style.css, foundation.js, and dynamicProjects.js. These files are responsible for the basic structure of the portfolio and rendering projects dynamically.

Form_Enhancement: Consists of index.html, style.css, foundation.js, dynamicProjects.js, and formEnhancement.js. These files handle the basic structure of the portfolio, project rendering, and contact form validation.


To run these projects, navigate to each folder and simply open index.html in your browser. You will be able to see the frontend of each project.


Additionally, there is an Assignment_Report.docx file provided alongside these folders. 
This document contains screenshots and code snippets related to the assignments.

Note: Please ignore the assets folder, as it only contains images used in these projects.
